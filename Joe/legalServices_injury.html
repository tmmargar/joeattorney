      <span style="text-align: unset;">JPV, PLLC has handled hundreds of personal injury claims on behalf of hospitals, doctors' offices and injured persons.  Often times two or all three of these groups will be represented by the same attorney.  You can count the fact that we will fight to get you the maximum amount possible for your claim. You can also be confident that, if we are not able to secure a fair settlement, we will proceed all the way to trial to assure that you get a fair opportunity at the full damages possible. (This is not how all firms work,  be advised!)<br><br>Before you even retain our office we will review your case and provide a realistic summary including likely outcomes, timelines and risk assessment.  We find that this is the best way to keep our clients informed, patient, and involved in the process and because of this extra effort,  our clients report a higher level of satisfaction. 
      <br /><br />
      JPV, PLLC maintains statistics on the success of cases we have handled and it shows that our firm was successful over 25% more often and with a 20% higher settlement rate then the previous firm's performance at one of our major hospital clients.  This level of success will translate to your case.  Count on it!

      <br />We understand that, at times, large businesses can benefit from interim management support.  The insertion of JPV, PLLC consultants into your operations allows your business not only the time to properly search and acquire a qualified, long term replacement but allows us the opportunity to analyze current functionality and breakthrough managerial roadblocks not previously addressed.
      <br /><br />
      Our interim director will begin our engagement with your staff by first analyzing the current operations such as current staff utilization, benchmarking standards, SOPs, management structure and techniques.  He will then incorporate your company's specific managerial and financial goals into a comprehensive solution and begin to implement those goals and report on his progress.  Our offered solutions will include detailed improvement targets, implementation SOPs and an action plan with realistic time tables for achieving expected results.
      <br /><br />
      OUR INTERIM MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PROVIDE:
      <ul>
       <li>Maximum Flexibility</li>

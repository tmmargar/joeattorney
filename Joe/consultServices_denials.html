      <span style="text-align: unset;">Forward thinking businesses usually prefer to focus on new business and avoid the unpredictability litigation is thought to encompass.  Our firm can show you how the proper use of litigation can take an area of revenue cycle weakness and turn it into your company's newest incremental cash flow.
      <br /><br />
      Litigation has been a primary focus of our firm for revenue enhancement since its inception. Joseph Villarosa has managed litigation teams and personally litigated thousands of commercial claims.  For over 17 years he has maintained an exceptionally high success rate compared to the industry.
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      Our firm begins dispute resolution with an in-depth analysis of the basis for denial followed by intensive and detailed discussions with the expected payors and opposing attorneys. These efforts have resulted in an impressive 75% success rate.
      <br /><br />
      If our non-litigation settlement attempts are unsuccessful, we immediately move into the litigation process to protect our client's position.  With very little assistance from the client, we are able to take an account from denied to paid status and without negatively impacting your company's A/R days. We maintain a 95% success rate within our commercial litigation department. Once we have an opportunity to fully understand the nature of a client's denial issue, we are then in an excellent position to provide process improvements to, "repair the current problem" and get your billing operations back to top efficiency through suggested operations changes and revised SOPs.   
      <br /><br />
      WE CAN ASSIST YOUR COMPANY WITH ANY DENIAL REDUCTION PROJECTS FROM ANY PAYOR DIVISION.
      <br /><br />

       <li>Insurance Claims</li>
       <li>Auto Accidents</li>

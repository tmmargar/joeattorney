      <br />One key to maximizing productivity and eliminating costly errors is to assure your staff is fully informed on industry changes. One missed change in the laws and regulations relating to billing or other claims submission requirements effect not only the claims already processed incorrectly but will continue to cost your company money until the problem is identified, the new requirements are fully analyzed and a comprehensive process change is developed, approved and implemented. The fastest way to assure you avoid these devastating revenue surprises is to keep our office engaged with your company's training department.
      <br /><br />
      OUR FIRM CAN WORK WITH YOUR TRAINING DEPARTMENT IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:
      <ul>
       <li>Identifying relevant changes in the laws or regulations that affect your industry</li>
       <li>Developing SOPs and instructional materials to educate staff</li>
       <li>Conducting seminars on specific areas of interest to provide your staff in depth knowledge of complex or legally based processes</li>
       <li>Retaining underperforming staff on essential processes</li>
      </ul>

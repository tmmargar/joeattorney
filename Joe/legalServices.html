      Litigation is a specialty in the legal field and within the area of litigation is a variety of sub-specialties.  Just because an attorney claims to handle litigation does not mean they have the necessary knowledge and experience to handle your company's case. This is why the law office of JPV, PLLC limits its litigation representation to a few specific areas.  We are primarily a plaintiff's side litigation firm.  That means, when you seek to enforce an agreement or otherwise demand compensation from another party, we will initiate the lawsuit against that party and fight to assure that you receive what you are seeking.
      <br /><br />
      Many of our litigation services are provided under a contingent fee structure.  That means you will not be charged unless we are successful.  This billing method is a win/win for the client and our firm.  The client is not burdened with unknown litigation costs and the attorney is motivated to produce the best result possible. Read more about our areas of expertise and see why we are the aggressive litigators you should retain when it's time to get serious about your legal rights.

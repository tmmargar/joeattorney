      <span style="text-align: unset;">
      Timely collection of accounts receivables is an ongoing concern for all businesses.  Without that available cash, your business is literally handcuffed from pursuing new opportunities.
      <br /><br />
      Partnering with a reliable law firm like JPV, PLLC will ease the pain of collecting your open invoices, reduce A/R days, increase expected yield and assure that your company stops working for free! 
      <br /><br />
      Time is the enemy in the collecting industry.  Accounts are literally dying each week that passes. The speed at which your chosen collector performs is critical to understanding your expected returns.  Unproductive time spent on your accounts can reduce your chances of collecting on those accounts by as much as 15-20% per month.  Within just six months your chances of collection can be as low as 40%.
